# JuliaFractalGenerator
Desktop application developed using C# that renders Julia fractal of different complex equations on Visual Studios. There are multiple methods of user input including inputting complex equations, clicking coordinates on the Mandelbrot set, or using preselects. Many user interactive features are enabled such as zooming into points, translating, and resetting back to original.
Download the repository and run it using Visual Studio debugger.
